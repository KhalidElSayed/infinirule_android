<H2><A NAME="Intro">Introduction</A></H2>
<P>Infinirule is a virtual slide rule. It transcends the limitations
of real physical slide rules by allowing variable precision—just keep
zooming in to get more—and automatically wrapping scales around—like a
circular slide rule, but without the bulk. And though it only shows
four scales at a time, you can select any combination of the available
scale types.

<P>Like most slide rules, Infinirule consists of 3 parts which can
move relative to each other: the top 2 scales are part of the
<I>body</I>, the bottom 2 are the <I>slide</I>, and there is also the
<I>cursor</I>, with a hairline for taking accurate readings. The top
two scales move together, as do the bottom two. Dragging the body
moves the entire rule left or right, while dragging the slide only
moves that. Use two fingers in either the body or the slide to
pinch-zoom the rule horizontally to adjust the precision. Dragging in
the space below or above the rule scales engages “precision” moving at
1/10th speed, for fine adjustments. You can move either the scales or
the cursor in this way.

<P>Long-tap on the scales to bring up a menu that lets you select
the scales to show. Long-tap on the cursor to copy/paste scale readings
to/from the clipboard.

<P>A slide rule is an example of an <I>analog computer</I>. Unlike the (nowadays) more
common <I>digital</I> computer, which uses a limited set of physical states (e.g.
“on” and “off” electrical signals) to encode digits of numbers, analog ones perform
computations by directly manipulating continuous physical quantities. In the case
of a slide rule, the quantities are lengths along graduated scales. The basic operation
is adding and subtracting of lengths, by sliding one scale relative to another before
taking a reading. However, by using suitable scale graduations, it is possible to
perform more complicated operations than just adding and subtracting numbers; for
example, the most basic slide rule scale is <I>logarithmic</I>, which allows you
to perform multiplication and division of two numbers by adding and subtracting
their logarithms.
<P>Analog computers used to be common back in the early part of the
20th century, when digital technology was expensive. And slide rules
were easier to carry around. But where the digital computers could
work on numbers with long strings of 7 or more digits (giving
correspondingly high precision), analog ones typically could only
manage about 3 digits of precision. Larger slide rules could go to
more digits, at the expense of becoming more unwieldy (and expensive
and difficult to make); Infinirule gives the same effect by letting
you zoom in to the scales.

<H2><A NAME="VersusConventionalSlideRules"></A>Comparison To Conventional Slide Rules</H2>

<P>Scales are named in Infinirule according to the mathematical
formula defining them, not according to the traditional slide rule scale
labels. Here is a table of correspondences between traditional labels
and Infinirule names:

</TABLE>

<P>Note the following points:
<UL>
<LI>Any scale may be selected on either the body or the slide. For
example, the traditional “K” scale is normally only found on the body,
but Infinirule also allows a “<I>y</I>³” scale on the slide. The
variable “<I>x</I>” is used for scales on the body, and “<I>y</I>” for
ones on the slide.
<LI>Trig scales are named as arcsine, arccos and arctan, because they
are in fact inverse trig functions of the <I>x</I> or <I>y</I> scales.
<LI>Cosine is separated from sine onto its own scale, rather than having
the numbers doubled up on the sine scale as with a traditional slide rule.
Similarly, the LL<SUB><I>n</I></SUB> scales with negative exponents are
separated out from the positive ones.
<LI>The “Wrap” column indicates whether the end of the scale
seamlessly continues on from the beginning. Scales are always drawn
with adjoining repeats, allowing you to take readings without worrying
about running off the end. For ones which don’t meaningfully wrap, a
red marker line is drawn on the scale to indicate the discontinuity.
